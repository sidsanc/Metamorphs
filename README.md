ABSTRACT
---

Ever since Donald Trump started his presidential journey, fake news has been on the rise. Not real news but fake news has taken the spot light in media nowadays. Especially with Trump supporters, they read news that are not true to the source and they choose to believe it without a single doubt occuring in their minds. There is a study showing that Americans are bad at judging if a piec eof news is real or fake. Not only does fake news make it harder for people to eee the truth, but also people are activly spreading Fake news, and unfortunately, it is causing people to be misinformationed on critical issues and creating a division in our society. So, Fake news needs to be labeled as such when it is published to the audience.  

We want to tackle this issue with Fake news and take what we have learnd from this data mining class and make a project that can detect fake news. Use it to tell the truth.
